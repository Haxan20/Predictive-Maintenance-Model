# Predictive Maintenance Demo with TensorFlow

This project demonstrates a proof-of-concept for a predictive maintenance system using deep learning. It uses a neural network built with **TensorFlow** to analyze simulated sensor data and predict the likelihood of mechanical failure.

## Overview

The model learns patterns from historical data to distinguish between normal operation and impending failure states. This serves as a template for understanding feature engineering, model architecture, and training workflows specific to timeseries industrial data.

## 🛠️ Built With
*   **TensorFlow** / **Keras**
*   **pandas** & **scikit-learn** for data processing
*   **Matplotlib** for visualization

## 📚 Educational Purpose
This project is intended **strictly for educational purposes**. It is a simplified example designed to teach concepts of time-series classification and deep learning applied to maintenance logistics. It is not robust enough for real-world deployment.
